# turtle_crossing_game

Run main.py to start the turtle crossing game.

The turtle starts at the bottom of the screen and can move up using the "Up" arrow key. Try to cross the screen till the top without hitting the cars passing by.

Upon a successful crossing, the turtle comes back to the initial position and triggers the next level of the game where the cars become faster. The game is over when the turtle hits any of the cars.

Enjoy!
